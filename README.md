# SyxUtil

A tool for editing prospect values in Songs of Syx, currently on v70.

This is an advanced tool that requires using a debugger to read/write game memory yourself. For information on how to hook a debugger to Songs of Syx, [refer to this guide](https://github.com/4rg0n/songs-of-syx-mod-example/blob/master/doc/howto/intellij_setup.md). The utility itself includes instructions for where to set breakpoints and what data to read/write.
